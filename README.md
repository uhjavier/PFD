# **Week 1 Reflection: Seamless Communication & Ideation**

The first week often blends excitement with uncertainty. This week highlighted our team's collaborative strength.

[Group]

We met on Monday, focusing on the problem statement and brainstorming. I shared my ideas, which were met with genuine interest.
We came up with over 10 enhancements that could be worked on to solve the challenge statement

But our standout was communication. New teams usually face initial hiccups, yet our interactions flowed effortlessly. Everyone was engaged, adding their insights.

I'm thankful for this strong start and remain hopeful for the journey ahead. Good communication means we're already on a winning path.

[Personal]

There were personally no downs yet, we're having a smooth communication with vast amount of ideas.

To more weeks of efficient teamwork and innovative solutions!

# **Week 2 Reflection: Gaining Traction & Streamlining Processes**
The second week can often be the true litmus test for a team. After the initial euphoria subsides, it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty of project execution.

[Group]

This week saw us diving deep into the Scrum framework. Monday's meeting was dedicated to assigning roles and understanding the responsibilities attached to them. Product Owner, Scrum Master, and developers—each of us knows what we need to do now.

We even identified our key stakeholders and brainstormed their potential concerns, aligning our objectives more closely with their expectations.

However, the real breakthrough was in Sprint Planning. We formulated our first sprint goal and selected key items from the product backlog to focus on. This level of specificity bodes well for our project’s future.

Communication remains our strong suit. But now, it's supplemented by clear processes and concrete planning.

[Personal]

On a personal note, I felt a greater sense of ownership this week. The stakes are clearer, and so is my role in the grand scheme of things. There's an added layer of responsibility, but it’s one I welcome.

This week confirmed my belief in our team's potential. We're not just maintaining the good start from last week; we’re building upon it.

Looking forward to more weeks of effective collaboration and bringing our vision to life!
